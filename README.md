About:   
Welcome to my personal website! Currently, it primarily features my resume, but it will evolve into a multi-page platform over time. This space serves as both my portfolio and playground, where I experiment with new and old technologies as part of my ongoing learning process.

---------

✨ Inspiration and Vision:   
My goal is to create an interactive and informative hub where visitors can explore my professional journey, projects, and skills. As I continue to develop this site, I aim to showcase my growth and expertise in various fields.

---------

🗂️ My stack :   

- build with React and Next js with Typescript.
- styled with Tailwind CSS.
- deployed on vercel. 

---------

🚀 It has the following features:
- super responsive & interactive (mobile-friendly) website 
- a resume PDF downloader!
- dark/Light Mode + All the animations you desire.

--------

🐛 Bugs:    
- need skills to be on same line in the Skills-section.
- uniform resume pdf downloader across all systems and devices.

---------

🔮 Future ideas:    
In the coming months, I plan to expand this website to include additional pages such as project showcases, multiple page, svg animation, pet chat integretion, feedback, animation, blog posts, and more. Stay tuned for exciting updates!   

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out with any feedback or inquiries.
